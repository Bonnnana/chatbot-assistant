## üîÑ Keeping FINKI AI Assistant Updated with Nanobrowser

FINKI AI Assistant is built on top of [Nanobrowser](https://github.com/nanobrowser/nanobrowser).  
To stay up to date with the latest Nanobrowser improvements **while keeping our custom FINKI workflows and prompt design**, we maintain a clean link to the upstream repository.

### üåê Remote Setup

In our Git workflow, we use **two remotes**:

- **origin** ‚Üí our repository (FINKI AI Assistant)  
- **upstream** ‚Üí the official Nanobrowser repository (read-only, fetch only)

This setup allows us to **pull updates from Nanobrowser** while keeping all pushes limited to our own repo.

```bash
# Add Nanobrowser as upstream (only once)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/nanobrowser/nanobrowser.git

# Verify remotes
git remote -v
# origin    https://github.com/Bonnnana/chatbot-assistant.git (our repo)
# upstream  https://github.com/nanobrowser/nanobrowser.git     (Nanobrowser official)

## Fetch Latest Changes from Upstream

Download the latest commits from the upstream repository without modifying your local files:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

This command:
- Downloads new commits, branches, and tags from upstream
- Does NOT change any of your local files
- Makes upstream changes available for merging/rebasing

---

## Update Your Local Main Branch

Switch to your main branch and apply the upstream changes.

###  Rebase

```bash
git checkout main
git rebase upstream/main
```

## Push Updates to Your Repository

After updating your local branch, push the changes to your forked repository:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

**Why `--force-with-lease`?**
- Rebase rewrites commit history, requiring a force push
- `--force-with-lease` is safer than `--force` - it prevents overwriting others' work

---

## Handling Conflicts

If you encounter merge conflicts during rebase:

1. **Review the conflicts** - Git will mark conflicted files
2. **Edit conflicted files** - Choose which changes to keep
3. **Mark conflicts as resolved:**
   ```bash
   git add <conflicted-file>
   ```
4. **Continue the process:**
   - `git rebase --continue`
